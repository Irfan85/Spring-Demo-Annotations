Do it scared.
Look how far you've come.
Each time you break your own boundaries to ensure that someone else likes you, you like yourself a little less.
Sitting in silence with you is all the noise I need.
There is nothing stronger than a broken woman who has rebuilt herself.
Every good and perfect gift is from above.
Love does not have have prerequisites like perfection, agreement or even likability.
The art of life is not controlling what happens to us, but using what happens to us.
Be careful who you trust. Salt and sugar look the same.
Tough love only works when there's as much love as there is tough.
Joy is what happens to us when we allow ourselves to recognize how good things really are.
Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.
Little by little, one travels far.
What good are wings, without the courage to fly.
She lives the poetry she cannot write.
I can't go back to yesterday because I was a different person then.
Don't let yesterday take up too much of today.
I never dreamed about success. I worked for it.
If you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain!
One person alone is not a full person; we exist in relation to others.
